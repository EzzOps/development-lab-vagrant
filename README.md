Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the Vagrantfile and how it sets up a VM with k3s installed, and how to access the cluster from your host machine:

1- Setting up the VM

The Vagrant.configure("2") block is where all the configuration for the VM is done.

```
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
config.vm.hostname = "EzzOps"
```
Here, we're specifying that we want to use the "ubuntu/bionic64" box (a pre-configured Vagrant box with Ubuntu 18.04), and we're setting the hostname of the VM to "EzzOps".

2- Network Configuration

```
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 6443, host: 6443
config.vm.network "public_network", use_dhcp_assigned_default_route: true
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
```
These lines set up the network for the VM. The first two lines forward ports from the guest VM to the host machine.

This means that if anything is running on port 80 or 6443 in the VM, it can be accessed on the host machine at ports 8080 and 6443 respectively.

The third line connects the VM to the public network, and the fourth line sets up a private network with the specified IP address.

3- Provisioning the VM
```
config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  apt-get update
SHELL

config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
SHELL
```

These lines are provisioning the VM, which means they're running commands to set up the environment. The first block updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations. Then, it installs Apache2. The second block installs k3s by downloading a script and running it.

4- Accessing the k3s cluster from the host machine

After the VM is up and running with k3s installed, you can access the k3s cluster from your host machine. To do this, you need to get the kubeconfig file from the VM. You can do this by running cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml in the VM. This will print the contents of the kubeconfig file.

Copy the output and paste it into a file on your host machine, let's say k3s.yaml. Now, you can use this file to access the k3s cluster from your host machine by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable to the path of this file: export KUBECONFIG=k3s.yaml.

Note: You might need to replace the server IP in the kubeconfig file with the IP of your VM (which is "192.168.33.10" in this case).
or 127.0.0.1

5- Exposing the API to the host machine

The line config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 6443, host: 6443 in the Vagrantfile is forwarding the port 6443 from the guest VM to the host machine. This is the default port that Kubernetes API servers listen on, so this line is allowing the Kubernetes API server in the VM to be accessed from the host machine.

6- Syncing Changes

To sync changes in the configuration files like network configuration or VirtualBox configuration, you can use the `vagrant reload` command. This command will restart the VM and apply any changes made to the Vagrantfile.

To sync changes in the script, you can use the `vagrant up --provision` command. This command will start the VM and run the provisioning scripts again, ensuring that any changes made to the script are applied.

Remember to run these commands from the terminal in the directory where your Vagrantfile is located.
